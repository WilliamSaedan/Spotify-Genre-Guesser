# Spotify-Genre-Guesser
A machine learning model trained on Spotify data that guesses the genre a song will most likely fit within

## Getting Started
To get started, follow the steps below:

- run `pip install numpy pandas seaborn sklearn` to install the dependencies
- open `Main.ipynb`
- ensure `music_genre.csv` is in the same directory as `Main.ipynb`
- Run the cells in `Main.ipynb` sequentially from top to bottom
- Pick an artist and a track name to input in the final cell to test the functionality of the models

The output shows the genre guessed by each of the models

The following models are used in the final guess:

- Neural Network
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machine
